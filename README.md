# DEPRECATED/LEGACY PIPPIN

This is the branch for the original version of Pippin (latest v2.1.2)

While it's still available on docker hub and on pypi, version 3.0 was rewritten from scratch in GOLang and is superior in every way.

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pippin-wallet)](https://pypi.org/project/pippin-wallet/) ![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pippin-wallet) [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/bbedward/pippin_nano_wallet)](https://github.com/bbedward/pippin_nano_wallet/blob/master/LICENSE) [![CI](https://github.com/appditto/pippin_nano_wallet/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/appditto/pippin_nano_wallet/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

Pippin is a production-ready, high-performance developer wallet for [Nano](https://nano.org) and [BANANO](https://banano.cc). Pippin's API is a drop-in replacement for the Nano developer wallet that is built in to the Nano node software.

## About Pippin

Pippin is written in Python. It achieves high performance across the board using libraries such as [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html), [uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop), [aiohttp](https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [asyncpg](https://github.com/MagicStack/asyncpg)/[aiosqlite](https://github.com/jreese/aiosqlite)/[aiomysql](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiomysql), and [rapidjson](https://rapidjson.org/).

For block signing and work generation, Pippin uses [nanopy](https://github.com/npy0/nanopy), which is a high-performance library that utilizes C-bindings for blake2b and ed25519.

## Benefits of Pippin

The Nano developer wallet (aka "node wallet") is not recommended for production use. One of the goals of Pippin is to provide a production-ready external key management that can be used by developers who are using Nano.

Pippin is the first drop-in replacement for the Nano developer wallet. It's incredibly easy to transition to Pippin if you are already using the Nano developer wallet.

- Pippin is independent of the node. You can use Pippin with any public RPC, so you don't have to run your own node
- Pippin is extremely fast and lightweight
- Pippin supports encrypted secret keys
- Pippin natively supports [BPoW](https://boompow.banano.cc)
- Pippin supports multiple database backends (SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL)

Pippin can be used by exchanges, games, payment processors, tip bots, faucets, casinos, and a lot more.

## Pippin Performance

<p align="center">  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appditto/pippin_nano_wallet/master/assets/benchmark.png" alt="Pippin Benchmarks"> </p>

The benchmark script that was used is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appditto/pippin_nano_wallet/master/benchmark.py)

There were 3 independent runs for each wallet, 62 blocks each, same node, and the same work peer. Pippin was consistently **twice as fast** versus the node wallet.

## How Pippin Works

Pippin provides an API that mimics the [Nano Wallet RPC Protocol](https://docs.nano.org/commands/rpc-protocol/#wallet-rpcs)

Every wallet-related RPC gets intercepted by Pippin and handled internally. It builds the blocks and signs them using locally-stored keys, it uses a node to publish the blocks.

Every non-wallet related RPC gets proxied to the publishing node. Which means you can make all of your RPC requests directly to Pippin whether they are wallet-related or not.

## API Documentation

Recommended reference is the [NANO RPC documentation](https://docs.nano.org/commands/rpc-protocol/#wallet-rpcs), Pippin's APIs are mostly identical.

You send an HTTP Post request to pippin with the desired action and parameters, example:

```
{
    "action": "accounts_create",
    "wallet": "12345",
    "count": 100
}
```

### Supported

- `wallet_create`
- `account_create`
- `accounts_create`
- `account_list`
- `receive`
- `send` - Use the **id** parameter to prevent duplicate sends!
- `account_representative_set`
- `password_change` - This will also set a password, if one isn't already set
- `password_enter`
- `password_valid`
- `wallet_representative_set`
- `wallet_add` - This is for adding ad-hoc private keys to a wallet
- `wallet_lock`
- `wallet_locked`
- `wallet_balances`
- `wallet_frontiers`
- `wallet_pending`
- `wallet_destroy`
- `wallet_change_seed`
- `wallet_contains`
- `wallet_representative`
- `receive_all` - Not in the nano API, it takes a `wallet` and it will receive every pending block in that wallet (respecting `receive_minimum`).

### Differences: Pippin vs NANO Node Wallet

These are the known differences between Pippin's API and the Nano node wallet API

**Different Behavior**

APIs that are different between Pippin and the Nano node wallet.

- `account_list` accepts a `count` parameter that defaults to 1000
- Pippin has an `auto_receive_on_send` option that will automatically receive pending blocks when you do a `send`, it will only do this if balance isnt high enough to make the transaction.
- `account_create` does not accept an index

**Fuzzy Behavior**

The Nano documentation isn't perfectly clear on these, but these are how Pippin behaves.

- `wallet_change_seed` will result in the wallet no longer being locked, if it is. The wallet has to already be unlocked before you can use this RPC, though.

**Missing/Not Implemented**

APIs that the Nano node wallet supports but are not implemented in Pippin.

- `account_move`
- `account_remove`
- `receive_minimum` - Receive minimum can be set in `config.yaml`
- `receive_minimum_set`
- `wallet_add_watch`
- `wallet_history`
- `search_pending`
- `search_pending_all`
- `wallet_export`
- `wallet_ledger`
- `wallet_republish`
- `wallet_work_get`
- `work_get`
- `work_set`

## CLI Documentation

Pippin has a CLI interface available, you can see available subcommands with:

`pippin-cli --help`

The primary goal of the CLI is key management. It's a more secure way to import a seed and backup your seed.

For example a typical flow of creating a new wallet with a specific seed might look like (add --encrypt to wallet_change_seed if you want to lock the wallet with a password):

```
% pippin-cli wallet_create
Wallet created, ID: d897b5ec-1897-4e7e-8a90-4526f454c8de
First account: nano_31a7wzm4rayik1hthahzkekntsqz86u6dko5adg8jxueehzt5yhmhsqsuzdy
% pippin-cli wallet_change_seed --wallet d897b5ec-1897-4e7e-8a90-4526f454c8de
Enter new wallet seed: <hidden_input>
Seed changed for wallet d897b5ec-1897-4e7e-8a90-4526f454c8de
First account: nano_3ejy6ha1iuqhi5cshhifu57p5othdcymfbzsmxhjucdks53eh41yd4qpjtxf
```

To backup a seed (**warning:** this prints seed to stdout)

```
% pippin-cli wallet_view_seed --wallet <id>
```

## Setting up Pippin

### Requirements

- Python 3.6 or newer
- GCC, for MacOS and Linux
- A Redis server

**MacOS Instructions**

1. Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/), if it isn't already installed

2. Install Redis (skip if you already have done so)

```
% brew install gcc@9 python redis
% launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.redis.plist
```

To start redis at boot (optional):

```
% ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/redis/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
```

You may find it convenient to priorize homebrew binaries by including the install location first in your PATH.

```
% export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
```

To make it permanent:

```
# Catalina
% echo "export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.zprofile
# Others
% echo "export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.profile
```

**Ubuntu 18.04**

Instructions for other debian-based Linux distributions should be similar.

```
% sudo apt install build-essential python3.6 python3.6-dev python3-pip redis-server
```

**CentOS 8**

Install the required developer tools:

```
# dnf install gcc redis python3-devel
```

The above may require the EPEL and PowerTools repos to be configured first:

```
# dnf install -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
# dnf config-manager --set-enabled PowerTools
```

**Redis basics for CentOS 8**

After installing Redis, create directories for the Redis config and runtime files:

```
# mkdir /etc/redis /var/redis /var/redis/6379
```

By default, the dnf install places Redis config files in /etc, move them to your dedicated folders:

```
# mv /etc/redis-sentinel.conf /etc/redis/
# mv /etc/redis.conf /etc/redis/6379.conf
```

Update your Redis config file to allow it to run in the background as a daemon, supervised by systemd:

```
# vim /etc/redis/6379.conf
	Set daemonize to yes (by default it is set to no).
	Set the pidfile to /var/run/redis_6379.pid (modify the port if needed).
	Change the port if necessary (6379 is the default).
	Set the logfile to /var/log/redis_6379.log
	Set the working dir to /var/redis/6379
	supervised systemd
```

Create the Systemd service to have Redis start automatically:

```
# vim /etc/systemd/system/redis.service
[Unit]
Description=Redis
After=syslog.target

[Service]
Type=notify
PIDFile=/var/run/redis_6379.pid
ExecStart=/usr/bin/redis-server /etc/redis/6379.conf --supervised systemd
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start the service:

```
# systemctl enable --now /etc/systemd/system/redis.service
```

Verify that Redis is running:

```
# systemctl status redis
# redis-cli ping
```

### Installing Pippin

First, update PIP to latest version.

```
% pip3 install -U pip
```

For MacOS you might need to set the following environment variable:

```
export CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc-9
```

To install Pippin on macos or Linux

```
% pip install --user pippin-wallet
```

Windows requires visual c++ and should be prefixed with USE_VC=1

```
% USE_VC=1 pip install pippin-wallet
```

To upgrade Pippin in the future, add --upgrade

```
% pip install --upgrade pippin-wallet
```

### Configuring Pippin

Pippin creates a `PippinData` directory in your home directory.

Run: `pippin-server --generate-config` to generate a sample in `~/PippinData/sample.config.yaml`

### Using BoomPoW

Want to use [BPoW](https://bpow.banano.cc)?

Pippin will use them automatically for work generation if the key is present in the environment.

For BPoW:

```
% echo "BPOW_KEY=service:mybpowkey" >> ~/PippinData/.env
```

### Configuring PostgreSQL or MySQL

Pippin uses SQLite by default, which requires no extra configuration.

To use postgres or mysql, you need to put your database information in some environment variables

**Postgres:**

Required (replace `database_name`, `user_name`, and `mypassword` with the actual values):

```
% echo "POSTGRES_DB=database_name" >> ~/PippinData/.env
% echo "POSTGRES_USER=user_name" >> ~/PippinData/.env
% echo "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword" >> ~/PippinData/.env
```

Optional:

```
# 127.0.0.1 is default
% echo "POSTGRES_HOST=127.0.0.1" >> ~/PippinData/.env
# 5432 is default
% echo "POSTGRES_PORT=5432" >> ~/PippinData/.env
```

**MySQL:**

Required (replace `database_name`, `user_name`, and `mypassword` with the actual values):

```
% echo "MYSQL_DB=database_name" >> ~/PippinData/.env
% echo "MYSQL_USER=user_name" >> ~/PippinData/.env
% echo "MYSQL_PASSWORD=mypassword" >> ~/PippinData/.env
```

Optional:

```
# 127.0.0.1 is default
% echo "MYSQL_HOST=127.0.0.1" >> ~/PippinData/.env
# 3306 is default
% echo "MYSQL_PORT=3306" >> ~/PippinData/.env
```

### Changing Redis Host/Port

Pippin uses Redis for distributed locks, so that every account works on its own chain in a synchronous fashion.

By default, it will look for redis on `127.0.0.1` on port `6379` and use db `0`, you can also change these with environment variables.

```
echo "REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1" >> ~/PippinData/.env
echo "REDIS_PORT=6379" >> ~/PippinData/.env
echo "REDIS_DB=0" >> ~/PippinData/.env
echo "REDIS_PW=supersecretpassword" >> ~/PippinData/.env
```

## Pippin Configuration

Pippin uses a [yaml](https://yaml.org/) based configuration for everything else.

All available options are in a [sample file](./pippin/sample.config.yaml).

You can override any default by creating a file called `~/PippinData/config.yaml` and choosing your own settings.

It must be in your users home directory in a folder called `PippinData`

### Configuring Pippin for BANANO

In `config.yaml` set banano: true

```
# Settings for the pippin wallet
wallet:
  # Run in banano mode
  # If true, the wallet will operate based on the BANANO protocol
  # Default: false
  banano: true
```

### Configuring the node

At the bare minimum, Pippin requires a node for the RPC api. It will default to `http://[::1]:7076` for Nano, or `http://[::1]:7072` for BANANO. If you want to change it to `https://coolnanonode.com/rpc` then it would look like this:

```
server:
  # The RPC URL of the remote node to connect to
  # Non-wallet RPCs will be routed to this node
  # Default: http://[::1]:7076 for nano, https://[::1]:7072 for banano
  node_rpc_url: https://coolnanonode.com/rpc
```

### Running Pippin

Once configured, just start it with `pippin-server`

It can be started on boot using systemd (Linux)

Create a file `/etc/systemd/system/pippin.service`

With the contents:

```
[Unit]
Description=Pippin Wallet
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=YOUR_LINUX_USER
Group=YOUR_LINUX_USER
ExecStart=/home/myuser/.local/bin/pippin-server

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

If you aren't sure what the full path of pippin-server is, run `which pippin-server`

Then enable and start

```
% sudo systemctl enable pippin
% sudo systemctl start pippin
```

### Endpoints

Send HTTP POST requests to Pippin just like you would a normal node.

```
% curl -g -d '{"action":"wallet_create"}' localhost:11338
% curl -g -d '{"action":"account_balance", "account": "nano_3jb1fp4diu79wggp7e171jdpxp95auji4moste6gmc55pptwerfjqu48okse"}' localhost:11338
```

### Auto-receive & Dynamic PoW

To automatically pocket pending transactions as they arrive, callback is required.

Hooking up the websocket also adds support for **dynamic PoW** which means that blocks will get confirmed faster if the active difficulty is higher than the minimum.

Pippin only supports the websocket callback, which can be setup like so in `config.yaml`:

```
server:
  # The WebSocket URL of the node to connect to
  # Optional, but required to receive transactions as they arrive to accounts
  # Default: None
  #node_ws_url: ws://[::1]:7078
```
